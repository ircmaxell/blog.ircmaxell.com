Well, my next talk is scheduled!  It will be [June 30th, 2011 at NYPHP](http://www.nyphp.org/PHP-Presentations/192_Cross-Site-Scripting-XSS-PHP-Security).  It's the first of a series of talks in collaboration with [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/), going over each of the [top 10 vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project).  This talk will be on Cross Site Scripting (XSS).

I'm going to go over what XSS is, and why it matters.  We will go into detail on the different facets and types of XSS that exist today.  Then, we will examine a real-world application that has known vulnerabilities (both looking for vulnerabilities and exploiting them).  Finally, we will talk about how to prevent XSS with PHP using a variety of techniques.


I am going to try to have the presentation recorded and either streamed live or posted as a YouTube video later. 


If you are in the New York area, come on it!  But reserve your seat early, space is limited.
