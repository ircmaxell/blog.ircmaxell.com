It's that time of the year again. A time to look back on all that was accomplished in the previous year, and a time to look forward to all that can be accomplished next year. Once again, let's look at what I was able to do this year:


<!--more-->
## Philosophy


In 2013, I tried to do something different. I tried to purposly be myself on the internet. Not a branding. Not a persona. But completely myself. At the beginning of the year, I purposly tried to put myself out there for everyone to see.


There are some things that I held back for myself, but for the vast majority, I was an open book.


I think this experiment worked. On one hand, I did get hurt from time to time. It's hard to not take things personally when you put yourself out completely. It wasn't a persona that people attacked, it was me. But that wasn't bad.


What did happen was that I made a lot of friends. I made a lot of connections. I gained a lot of confidence in myself.

## Beyond


This ultimately led to me writing the [Beyond Series](http://blog.ircmaxell.com/search/label/Beyond) of posts.


There is something about those posts which I never really said completely. Every one of those 4 posts was me putting my vulnerable ideas out in front of the world. None of those ideas were fully formed. None of them were vetted. All of them had ideas of my own which I've never seen before posted by others. They were really just ideas that I've had that I wasn't able to fully flush out.


Basically, I put my raw and unadulterated ideas out in front of the world. I put my most vulnerable thoughts. I took a chance by showing all my cards. And it was so well received that I couldn't be happier!


Some people complained that they "weren't my best work". That "they could have been written better and better thought out". And honestly, I took those as compliments. Because rather than spend a year trying to think each one through and write them out as best as I could, I shared. And even if you think it wasn't my best work, that's fine because it wasn't supposed to be. It was supposed to be a raw glimpse into what I've not been sure of. Into what I've not fully developed...


But enough of all of that, on to the stats!!!
